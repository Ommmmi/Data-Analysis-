# Data-Analysis-
This repository showcases a collection of end-to-end data analysis projects that leverage Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to extract meaningful insights from real-world datasets. Each project focuses on a unique domain to demonstrate data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and storytelling:

YouTube Channel Performance Analytics: Analyzed a dataset of YouTube videos to uncover patterns in engagement metrics like views, likes, and comments. Identified top-performing content and key factors driving audience interaction.

Global Population Analysis: Explored historical population data across countries and continents. Used data visualization techniques to highlight trends, growth patterns, and demographic shifts over time.

TCS Stock History Analysis: Performed time series analysis on Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) stock data. Visualized stock trends, volatility, and calculated moving averages to study market behavior.

These projects reflect strong proficiency in data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to communicate data-driven insights effectively.
